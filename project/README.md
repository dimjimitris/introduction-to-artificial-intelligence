# Sentiment Analysis for Course EARIN in WUT

This project aims to perform sentiment analysis for course "EARIN" (Introduction to Artificial Intelligence) at the Warsaw University of Technology (WUT). 

## Description
Sentiment analysis (or opinion mining) involves identifying and categorizing opinions expressed in a text to determine whether the attitude is positive, negative, or neutral. The task will involve classifying customer reviews from the Amazon Reviews dataset available at Kaggle, so we consider it to be a classification task and, more specifically, since our dataset does not include neutral reviews, it reduces to a binary classification task. This project aims to develop, compare and improve multiple machine learning models for sentiment analysis and determine the best-performing approach.
