# EARIN - 1st mini-project
The goal is to write a program that solves a maze using greedy best-first search algorithm. The maze is a 2D grid with empty spaces, walls, a start, and an end position. The objective is to return a number of steps from start to end position, and everything needed to visualize the search procedure. Two heuristics h(n) at least will be implemented.
Different test cases and corner cases will be evaluated as the code will be run against different test cases, to make sure it works properly.
A simple console step-by-step visualization of the algorithm will be provided, following the lead of the example solution: https://angeluriot.com/maze_solver/.

Differences of results obtained by different heuristics will be discussed in a report, with test cases that show the strengths and weaknesses of the algorithm, and explanation of the choice of test cases will be provided as well.
